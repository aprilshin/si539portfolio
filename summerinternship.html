      <h2>My unforgettable summer at Uber</h2>
      <p>Over the summer 2019, I interned as a product designer at Uber, as part of the Uber Eats team. While completing several projects, I was mainly reponsible for proposing design solutions to tackle courier pricing comprehension problems. 

      <br><br>In the process, I closely worked with a team of UX researchers, writers, designers, PMs, and engineers and received constant feedback. It was such a wonderful opportunities for me to work, learn, and grow with one of the smartest people in the industry.

        <br><br>Due to NDA, I am not able to share detailed project materials until the product launches publicly. If you would like to learn more about my experience, <span class="bold">please feel free to reach out to me.</span>
        
        <br><br>Also, I've already published a write-up about my learnings at Uber on Medium. Enjoy! :)

      <h2>Key Learnings</h2>
      <p>
        <span class="bold">1. Know who your core users are</span>
        <br>I am someone who always pays a lot of attention in making things look cool. The majority of my designs have always been
        based on a mockup of the most recent iPhone; I thought that was the best way to present my design. However, I was wrong.
        What’s more important is trying to have a complete understanding of my core users. Place the priority on knowing who your users are before you focus on the aesthetics of the design.

        <br><br><span class="bold">2. Be an expert on your product</span>
        <br>Even though it was only a three-month internship, people started to come find me to ask questions regarding my product,
        which made me think: “I must keep working hard to be an expert on my product once I own it. By doing this, whenever I am
        asked questions, I can be confident in my knowledge and be able to provide more valuable answers to my team.”
        
        <br><br><span class="bold">3. Be a great communicator</span>
        <br>As a designer, I must 1) listen carefully to what different stakeholders say, 2) incorporate the ideas and thoughts
        across the teams, and 3) draw a line for what should be prioritized for the core users in my design solution. In this
        regard, I tried to have every decision that I made be fully supported through sufficient communication between the
        stakeholders, the team, and myself.
        
        <br><br><span class="bold">4. Be a strategic thinker</span>
        <br>International companies like Uber have countless business factors to consider, and design is not an exception. While I
        am designing, I’ve tried my very best to leverage my knowledge and previous professional experiences as an analyst and
        consultant — I found that these experiences were very helpful.
        I found that it is critical to not only present the design itself, but also clearly demonstrate why my design matters to
        the business and how it can play a strategic role within it.
        
        <br><br><span class="bold">5. Always be inspired</span>
        <br>During my internship, I met numerous people who inspired me not only as a designer but also as a person. Some inspiring
        advice I received were:
        <br><br><span class="italic">a. Find a product that you wish to spend the rest of your life on and find some great people to build it with you; 
        <br>b. Build your UX career by strategically positioning yourself;
        <br>c. Do not join the company if you do not find a passionate manager/team who is truly excited to grow you;
        <br>d. Start designing with small changes. No matter what, they ARE making changes</span>
